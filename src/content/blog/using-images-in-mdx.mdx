# Using Images in MDX Blog Posts

One of the most powerful features of MDX is the ability to use custom React components within your markdown content. This blog post demonstrates how to use the custom image component we've created to add beautiful, responsive images to your blog posts.

## Basic Image Usage

Here's a basic example of using an image in your MDX content:

![A beautiful landscape](/images/blog/landscape.svg)

The image above uses the default size (medium) and doesn't have a caption.

## Image Sizes

Our custom MDX image component supports different sizes:

### Small Image

![A small image example](/images/blog/small-example.svg?size=small)

### Medium Image (Default)

![A medium image example](/images/blog/medium-example.svg)

### Large Image

![A large image example](/images/blog/large-example.svg?size=large)

### Full Width Image

![A full width image example](/images/blog/full-example.svg?size=full)

## Adding Captions

You can also add captions to your images:

![A beautiful sunset over the mountains](/images/blog/sunset.svg?caption=A beautiful sunset over the mountains captured during golden hour)

## Advanced Usage

For more control, you can specify both size and caption:

![City skyline at night](/images/blog/city-night.svg?size=large&caption=City skyline at night with lights reflecting on the water)

## Conclusion

Using images in your MDX blog posts is now easier than ever. With our custom component, you can:

1. Add images with different sizes
2. Include descriptive captions
3. Ensure responsive behavior across devices
